By leveraging biometric authentication, the system ensured secure and tamper-proof attendance records while significantly reducing administrative overhead. The project covered over 20+ employees across three store locations, including provisions for remote and field staff through a mobile face scan app. \n This strategic implementation not only addressed key operational pain points but also positioned 7thgrocery as a forward-thinking employer investing in transparency, efficiency, and employee satisfaction. \n ",
            "challenge": "7thgrocery Store was grappling with significant inefficiencies in its workforce management system. The company relied on manual attendance tracking methods, including paper logs and ID cards, which frequently resulted in data entry errors and inconsistencies. One of the most pressing issues was the prevalence of buddy punching—where employees clocked in or out on behalf of their colleagues—leading to inflated labor costs and a lack of accountability. \n Additionally, the payroll process was heavily manual, requiring over five days of HR effort each month to compile, verify, and process employee data. This not only strained the HR department but also delayed salary disbursements and created dissatisfaction among employees. Compounding these challenges was the lack of real-time visibility into attendance across multiple factory locations, which made workforce oversight and decision-making increasingly difficult. Collectively, these issues hampered productivity, compromised compliance, and eroded trust in the company’s time and attendance system.",
            "approach": "To address the challenges faced by 7th Grocery Store, we deployed an integrated Face Recognition-Based Payroll and Attendance System designed for accuracy, automation, and scalability. At the core of the solution were AI-powered face recognition terminals installed at all entry and exit points. These terminals enabled fast, secure, and contactless employee identification, significantly reducing errors and eliminating the possibility of buddy punching. \n To accommodate remote and field employees, a mobile face scan application was introduced, allowing them to log attendance securely from any location. A real-time attendance dashboard was also implemented, giving HR personnel and department heads instant visibility into workforce data across all locations. \n The system was further enhanced with an automated payroll module that synced seamlessly with attendance records, enabling precise calculation of working hours, overtime, and deductions. Leave management was also integrated, ensuring that all approved leaves were factored into the final payroll. For the mobile workforce, geo-fencing and GPS-based logging features were added to validate attendance locations and enhance accountability. Together, these components created a comprehensive, automated system that revolutionized how 7Th Grocery manages time, attendance, and payroll.",
